          Hello,

          It looks like there hasn't been any recent updates on this
          Klipper github issue.  If you created this issue and no
          longer consider it open, then please login to github and
          close the issue.  Otherwise, if there is no further activity
          on this thread then it will be automatically closed in a few
          days.

          Best regards,

          ~ Your friendly GitIssueBot
