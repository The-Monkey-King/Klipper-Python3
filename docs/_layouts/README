This directory defines the https://www.klipper3d.org/ website. The
site is hosted using "github pages" (which uses Jekyll to
automatically convert the markdown files in the docs/ directory to
html). In addition to the files in this directory, the docs/CNAME and
docs/_config.yml file also control the website generation.
