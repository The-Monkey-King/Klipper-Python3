## Submitting a pull request

Contributions of Code and documentation are managed through github
pull requests.  Each commit should have a commit message formatted
similar to the following:

```
module: Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 75
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines..

Signed-off-by: My Name <myemail@example.org>
```

It is important to have a "Signed-off-by" line on each commit - it
certifies that you agree to the
[developer certificate of origin](developer-certificate-of-origin). It
must contain your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous
contributions) and contain a current email address.
